## Overview
This document provides an overview of different computer vision techniques used for image processing, including their objectives, neural networks used, and real-world applications.

## Summary of how these techniques are applied in image processing:

| **Task**               | **Objective**                               | **Networks Used**               | **Use Cases**                                    |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Image Classification**| Assign a label to the entire image          | Traditional CNNs (LeNet, AlexNet) | Medical diagnosis, object classification in photos |
| **Object Detection**    | Locate objects and classify them            | R-CNN, YOLO, Faster R-CNN        | Autonomous vehicles, security cameras            |
| **Image Segmentation**  | Assign labels to each pixel                 | FCN, U-Net                       | Medical images, agriculture, autonomous vehicles |
| **Image Generation**    | Create realistic or transformed images      | GANs, VAEs                       | Generative art, deepfakes, text-to-image generation |

## Examples of Object Detection
Here are a couple of examples of object detection applications:
* [Hand Detection](https://github.com/Nicolasrm12508/Vision/blob/4b86cbb9de40a1267ea3eda61d2d007c5f360918/Hand_Detection.html) - A demo of detecting hands in real-time.
* [Hand Detection Landmark](https://gerardomunoz.github.io/Vision/Hand_Detection_LandMark.html) - Example showcasing hand landmark detection for gesture recognition.
